## 6.3 Landmark Recognition

### 6.3.1 Project Introduction

Program the AiHand to recognize traffic signs via the WonderCam vision module. The robotic hand executes corresponding feedback actions based on the recognized traffic signs, such as **"extending index finger"**, **"rotating to the left",** **"rotating to the right",** **"rotating left and right"**, and **"returning to the initial position"**.

### 6.3.2 Program Flowchart

<img src="../_static/media/chapter_6/section_3/image2.png" class="common_img" />

### 6.3.3 Module Introduction

In this section, the WonderCam vision module is used for recognizing traffic signs. For more details, please refer to instructions in the [6.1 WonderCam Introduction](#anchor_6_1).

### 6.3.4 Program Analysis

(1) When AiHand is turned on, initialize the `micro:bit` and the `WonderCam` vision module. Switch the function of the vision module to landmark recognition. Set the angle of 6 servos to 90°. Servos 1 to 5 correspond to the thumb to little finger of the robotic hand. Servo 6 corresponds to the pan-tilt. Then, set the variable **"next"** to 0.

<img src="../_static/media/chapter_6/section_3/image3.png" class="common_img" />

(2) Define two functions **"Close fingers"** and **"Extend index finger"**. Set proper servo angles to control the robotic hand to make gestures of closing the fingers or extending the index finger.

<img src="../_static/media/chapter_6/section_3/image4.png" class="common_img" />

<img src="../_static/media/chapter_6/section_3/image5.png" class="common_img" />

(3) In the **"forever"** loop, update and obtain the landmark recognition results. When the maximum confidence of the landmark recognition is greater than or equal to 0.4, add 1 to **"next"**. When it is greater than or equal to 0.4 for 6 consecutive times, proceed to filter the following recognition results.

<img src="../_static/media/chapter_6/section_3/image6.png" class="common_img" />

(4) Filter the recognition results.

① When the recognized landmark with the maximum confidence is 1, the robotic hand will extend the index finger, and the servo 6 will rotate to 90° to make the robotic hand face forward.

② When the recognized landmark with the maximum confidence is 2, the robotic hand will extend the index finger, and the servo 6 will rotate to 180° to make the robotic hand face towards the left.

③ When the recognized landmark with the maximum confidence is 3, the robotic hand will extend the index finger, and the servo 6 will rotate to 0° to make the robotic hand face towards the right.

<img src="../_static/media/chapter_6/section_3/image8.png" class="common_img" />

When the recognized landmark with the maximum confidence is 4, all servos of the robotic hand will rotate to 90° to make the robotic hand return to its initial position.

<img src="../_static/media/chapter_6/section_3/image9.png" class="common_img" />

When the recognized landmark with the maximum confidence is 5, the robotic hand will close, and the servo 6 will rotate to 90° to make it face forward. Then, control servo 6 to switch back and forth between 45° and 135° twice. Next, set the angle of servo 6 to 90° to return it to the initial position.

## 6.5 Waste Sorting

### 6.5.1 Project Introduction

Code the AiHand to recognize waste cards via the WonderCam vision module. Once a waste card is recognized, the RGB light on the `micro:bit` expansion board will light up in the corresponding color. The robotic hand will grab the card and place it in the designated position.

### 6.5.2 Program Flowchart

<img src="../_static/media/chapter_6/section_5/image2.png" class="common_img" />

### 6.5.3 Module Introduction

In this section, the WonderCam vision module is used for recognizing traffic signs. For more details, please refer to instructions in the [6.1 WonderCam Introduction](#anchor_6_1).

### 6.5.4 Program Analysis

(1) When AiHand is turned on, initialize the `micro:bit`, `WonderCam` vision module, and `RGB LED`. Switch the function of the vision module to image classification. Set the brightness of the `RGB LED` to 255. Create the variable `next` and set it to 0. Call the `Reset` function to return the robotic hand to its initial position.

<img src="../_static/media/chapter_6/section_5/image3.png" class="common_img" />

① The `next` variable counts the number of times an image is recognized during the recognition process. Set the robotic hand to start sorting only after the image has been recognized 8 times. This prevents false recognition.

② The `Reset` function sets the angles of servos 1 to 5 to 90°, which corresponds to a half-clenched gesture of the robotic hand.

<img src="../_static/media/chapter_6/section_5/image4.png" class="common_img" />

(2) In the `forever` loop, continuously update and obtain recognition results from the vision module. If the maximum confidence level is greater than 0.4, add the `next` variable by 1. If it is greater than 0.4 for 8 consecutive recognition, reset the `next` to 0. Record the recognition results in the `recognition result` variable.

<img src="../_static/media/chapter_6/section_5/image5.png" class="common_img" />

(3) Call the corresponding function to execute the waste sorting, based on the recognition result.

<img src="../_static/media/chapter_6/section_5/image6.png" class="common_img" />

If the waste cards of IDs 2 to 4 are recognized, call the `Hazardous waste` function. Set all RGB lights on the expansion board to turn red. Call the "**Grab**" function to grab the waste card. Rotate servo 6 to 180°. Then. call the "**Reset**" function to reopen the robotic hand. Turn off the lights. Make servo 6 rotate back to 90°. The hazardous waste sorting is completed.

<img src="../_static/media/chapter_6/section_5/image7.png" class="common_img" />

If the waste cards of IDs 5-7 are recognized, call the `Recyclable waste` function. The processing is the same as above. The RGB lights on the expansion board will turn blue. After the waste card is grabbed, make servo 6 rotate to 45°. Then, return the robotic hand to the initial position and turn off the RGB lights.

<img src="../_static/media/chapter_6/section_5/image8.png" class="common_img" />

If the waste cards of IDs 8 to 10 are recognized, call the `Kitchen waste` function. Set all RGB lights on the expansion board to red. After the waste card is grasped, rotate servo 6 to 135°. Make the robotic hand place the waste card down. Turn off the RGB lights, and reset servo 6.

<img src="../_static/media/chapter_6/section_5/image9.png" class="common_img" />

If the waste cards of IDs 11 to 13 are recognized, call the `Other waste` function. Set all RGB lights on the expansion board to white. After the waste card is grasped, rotate servo 6 to 0°. Place the waste card down. Turn off the lights, and reset servo 6.

<img src="../_static/media/chapter_6/section_5/image10.png" class="common_img" />

(4) Define the `Grab` function to control the robotic hand to close and grip the waste card. Servo 1 corresponds to the thumb. Servos 2 to 5 correspond to the index finger to the pinky finger. The installation direction of the `servo 1` is different from the other servos. When the servo is at 90°, it is in a neutral position. The closer `servo 1` is to 0°, the more open the thumb will be. Similarly, the closer servos 2 to 5 are to 0°, the more closed the fingers will be. Therefore, set `servo 1` to 150° and `servos 2` to `5` to 30° to close the hand.

<img src="../_static/media/chapter_6/section_5/image11.png" class="common_img" />

### 6.7.3 Module Introduction

In this section, the WonderCam vision module is used for recognizing traffic signs. For more details, please refer to instructions in the [6.1 WonderCam Introduction](#anchor_6_1).

### 6.7.4 Program Analysis

(1) When AiHand is turned on, initialize the `micro:bit` and `WonderCam` vision module. Switch the function of the vision module to face recognition. Set the rotation angle of servos 1 to 6 to 90 degrees. The robotic hand is in a half-clenched gesture.

<img src="../_static/media/chapter_6/section_7/image3.png" class="common_img" />

(2) In the **"forever"** loop, update the recognition results of the vision module. If a face is recognized, judge the recognized face.

<img src="../_static/media/chapter_6/section_7/image4.png" class="common_img" />

(3) If a learned face ID is recognized, make the robotic hand open and close twice.

<img src="../_static/media/chapter_6/section_7/image5.png" class="common_img" />

When the robotic hand is closed, set the angle of servo 1 to 130 degrees, and that of servos 2 to 5 to 50 degrees.

<img src="../_static/media/chapter_6/section_7/image6.png" class="common_img" />

① Servo 1 corresponds to the thumb. Servos 2 to 5 correspond to the index finger to the little finger of the robotic hand. The installation direction of the thumb servo is opposite to that of the other servos. Therefore, when the fingers are bent, their rotation angles are opposite.

② With 90 degrees as the neutral position, the closer `servo 1` is to 0 degrees, the more the thumb is open. The closer servos 2 to 5 are to 0 degrees, the more the fingers are closed.

(4) If a learned face is not recognized, make the pan-tilt servo turn left and right twice before returning to the neutral position.

<img src="../_static/media/chapter_6/section_7/image7.png" class="common_img" />

(5) If no face is recognized, make the robotic hand return to the half-clenched gesture.

## 6.8 Face Detection

### 6.8.1 Project Introduction

Turn on the robotic hand. It will rotate left and right with a half-clenched gesture. The WonderCam vision module will simultaneously search for the learned face. If a learned face is detected, the robotic hand will make a waving gesture by opening and closing its fingers. If no face is detected, it will continue searching for the learned face.

Before starting this game, please access the [6.6 Facial Recognition Function Introduction](#anchor_6_6) to learn about face ID.

### 6.8.2 Program Flowchart

### 6.8.3 Module Introduction

In this section, the WonderCam vision module is used for recognizing traffic signs. For more details, please refer to instructions in the [6.1 WonderCam Introduction](#anchor_6_1).

### 6.8.4 Program Analysis

(1) When AiHand is turned on, initialize the `micro:bit` and `WonderCam` vision module. Switch the function to face recognition. Call the `Initial gesture` function to set the rotation angles of servos 1 to 5 to 90 degrees, making the robotic hand be in a half-clenched gesture. Then, set the angle of `servo 6` to 90 degrees to make the robotic hand face forward. Configure the `angle` to 90 and the `state` to 1 for calculating the rotation angle of the pan-tilt servo.

<img src="../_static/media/chapter_6/section_8/image3.png" class="common_img" />

① In the `Initial gesture` function, set the angles of servos 1 to 5 to 90 degrees. This makes the robotic hand be in a half-clenched gesture.

<img src="../_static/media/chapter_6/section_8/image4.png" class="common_img" />

(2) In the `forever` code, update the recognition results of the vision module.

<img src="../_static/media/chapter_6/section_8/image5.png" class="common_img" />

(3) If a learned face ID is recognized, the robotic hand opens and closes its fingers three times. Then, it returns to the half-clenched gesture. The `Close robotic hand`, `Open robotic hand`, and `Initial gesture` sub-functions are called.

<img src="../_static/media/chapter_6/section_8/image6.png" class="common_img" />

In the `Close robotic hand` function, set the angle of servo 1 to 130 degrees and the angles of servos 2 to 5 to 50 degrees.

<img src="../_static/media/chapter_6/section_8/image7.png" class="common_img" />

① Servo 1 corresponds to the thumb. Servos 2 to 5 correspond to the index finger to the little finger of the robotic hand. The installation direction of the thumb servo is opposite to that of the other servos. Therefore, when the fingers are bent, their rotation angles are opposite.

② With 90 degrees as the neutral position, the closer `servo 1` is to 0 degrees, the more the thumb is open. The closer servos 2 to 5 are to 0 degrees, the more the fingers are closed.

In the `Open robotic hand` function, set the angle of servo motor 1 to 50 degrees, and the angles of servos 2 to 5 to 130 degrees.

<img src="../_static/media/chapter_6/section_8/image8.png" class="common_img" />

(4) If no learned face is detected, make the pan-tilt servo turn left and right. The **"Rotate pan-tilt"** function is called.

<img src="../_static/media/chapter_6/section_8/image9.png" class="common_img" />

In the "**Rotate pan-tilt**" function, determine the `angle` variable.

① If the `angle` is greater than or equal to 180 degrees, the pan-tilt rotates to the right from your viewpoint, set the `state` variable to -1. This decreases the `angle` variable by 1, enabling the pan-tilt servo to rotate to the left.

② If the `angle` is less than or equal to 0 degrees, the pan-tilt rotates to the left from your viewpoint, set the `state` variable to 1. This increases the `angle` variable by 1, enabling the pan-tilt servo to rotate to the right.

<img src="../_static/media/chapter_6/section_8/image10.png" class="common_img" />

:::{Note}
"**180**" and "**0**" are the limits of the pan-tilt servo. When the pan-tilt servo rotates to 180 degrees, it has reached the right limit position. It needs to be turned to the left. Therefore, the `state` variable is set to decrease the `angle` value, enabling the pan-tilt to rotate to the left. The same method applies when the pan-tilt servo rotates to 0 degrees.

## 6.10 Number Recognition

### 6.10.1 Project Introduction

This section utilizes the WonderCam vision module on the AiHand to recognize number cards. When a number is recognized, the robotic hand will extend the corresponding numbers of fingers.

### 6.10.2 Program Flowchart

<img src="../_static/media/chapter_6/section_10/image2.png" class="common_img" />

### 6.10.3 Module Introduction

In this section, the WonderCam vision module is used for recognizing traffic signs. For more details, please refer to instructions in the [6.1 WonderCam Introduction](#anchor_6_1).

### 6.10.4 Program Analysis

(1) When AiHand is turned on, initialize the `micro:bit` and `WonderCam` vision module. Switch the function to number recognition. Call the **"Initial gesture"** function to set the initial gesture of the robotic hand to a fist. Create a **"number"** variable and set it to 0. This allows the robotic hand to extend the specified numbers of fingers.

<img src="../_static/media/chapter_6/section_10/image3.png" class="common_img" />

(2) Define a **"Initial gesture"** function, enabling the robotic hand to make a fist when calling it.

<img src="../_static/media/chapter_6/section_10/image4.png" class="common_img" />

① Servo 1 corresponds to the thumb. Servos 2 to 5 correspond to the index finger to the little finger of the robotic hand. The installation direction of the thumb servo is opposite to that of the other servos. Therefore, when the fingers are bent, their rotation angles are opposite.

② With 90 degrees as the neutral position, the closer `servo 1` is to 0 degrees, the more the thumb is open. The closer servos 2 to 5 are to 0 degrees, the more the fingers are closed.

③ Set `servo 1` to 140° and `servos 2` to `5` to 40° to close the robotic hand.

(3) In the `forever` loop, continuously update and obtain the recognition result of the vision module. If the recognized number with the maximum confidence level is not equal to 0, update and obtain the recognition result again. Recheck whether the recognition result is still not equal to 0. If it is, set the`number` variable to the number with the maximum confidence level. Then, determine the `Number` variable. If it is greater than 5, set the number to 5.

<img src="../_static/media/chapter_6/section_10/image5.png" class="common_img" />

:::{Note}
The confidence level refers to the matching degree between the number in the current recognized image and the number model learned. The higher the matching degree, the higher the confidence level. Therefore, the number with the highest confidence level is typically considered the recognition result.
:::

(4) Set the value of the `temporary variable` to 1. It controls the fingers to extend in a specific order. Call the loop code block to repeatedly extend the fingers based on the recognized numbers. Increment the `temporary variable` by 1. If it is equal to 6, indicating all 5 fingers need to be extended, control `servo 1` to rotate to an angle of 50° to extend the thumb. If it is not equal to 6, set the angles of servos 2 to 5 in order to 130° to extend the other fingers. This allows the five fingers of the robotic hand to be extended in a specific order.

<img src="../_static/media/chapter_6/section_10/image6.png" class="common_img" />

(5) If no number is recognized, call the **"Initial gesture"** function again to make the robotic hand return to the initial position.

<img src="../_static/media/chapter_6/section_10/image7.png" class="common_img" />

## 6.12 Color Recognition

### 6.12.1 Project Introduction

If the AiHand's WonderCam vision module recognizes a red ball, the robotic hand will grab it and place it on the left. If a green ball is recognized, the robotic hand will grab it and place it on the right. The rotation direction is determined from your perspective when facing the camera of the vision module.

Before starting this game, please access the [6.11 Color Recognition Function Introduction](#anchor_6_11) to learn about color IDs. Red is `ID1`, and green is `ID2`.

### 6.7.2 Program Flowchart

<img src="../_static/media/chapter_6/section_12/image2.png" class="common_img" />

### 6.12.3 Module Introduction

In this section, the WonderCam vision module is used for recognizing traffic signs. For more details, please refer to instructions in the [ 6.1 WonderCam Introduction](#anchor_6_1).

### 6.12.4 Program Analysis

(1) When AiHand is turned on, initialize the `micro:bit`, `WonderCam` vision module, and `RGB LED`. Switch the function to color recognition. Set the brightness of the `RGB LED` to 255. Set the servo angle to 90° to put the robotic hand in its initial state, which is a half-clenched gesture. Then, create a variable `color` and set it to 0.

<img src="../_static/media/chapter_6/section_12/image3.png" class="common_img" />

(2) In the `forever` loop, update and obtain the recognition result. If `color ID1` (red) is recognized, control all `RGB LEDs` on the expansion board to turn red. The buzzer makes a sound. Call the `Grab` function to make the robotic hand grab the ball. `Servo 6` is controlled to rotate to 180°, which corresponds to the left side. Call the `Open` function to place the ball on the left. Then, reset `servo 6` in this function.

<img src="../_static/media/chapter_6/section_12/image4.png" class="common_img" />

Similarly, if color ID2 is recognized, the robotic hand grabs the ball. The servo 6 is controlled to rotate to 0°. This rotates the robotic hand to the right side. Then, the ball is released.

<img src="../_static/media/chapter_6/section_12/image5.png" class="common_img" />

(3) Define the **"Grab"** function to control the `servo 1` to rotate to an angle of 130°, and servos 2 to 5 to rotate to an angle of 50°.

① Servo 1 corresponds to the thumb. Servos 2 to 5 correspond to the index finger to the little finger of the robotic hand. The installation direction of the thumb servo is opposite to that of the other servos. With 90 degrees as the neutral position, the closer `servo 1` is to 0 degrees, the more the thumb is open. The closer servos 2 to 5 are to 0 degrees, the more the fingers are closed.

② Therefore, if you want the robotic hand to grip the ball, set the `servo 1` to 130° and `servos 2` to `5` to 50°. This enables the robotic hand to close.

<img src="../_static/media/chapter_6/section_12/image6.png" class="common_img" />

(4) Define the function `Open`. Control the servos 1 to 5 to rotate to an angle of 90° to return the robotic hand to its initial gesture. After a delay of 800ms, control the `servo 6` to reset to 90°.

<img src="../_static/media/chapter_6/section_12/1.gif" class="common_img" />

## 6.13 Color Tracking

### 6.13.1 Project Introduction

If AiHand's WonderCam vision module recognizes `color ID1`, the pan-tilt servo of the robotic hand will follow the movement of `color ID1`.

Before starting this game, please refer to instructions in the [6.11 Color Recognition Function Introduction](#anchor_6_11) to learn about `color ID1`.

### 6.13.2 Program Flowchart

<img src="../_static/media/chapter_6/section_13/image2.png" class="common_img" />

### 6.13.3 Module Introduction

In this section, the WonderCam vision module is used for recognizing traffic signs. For more details, please refer to instructions in the [6.1 WonderCam Introduction](#anchor_6_1).

### 6.13.4 Program Analysis

(1) When AiHand is turned on, initialize the `micro:bit` and `WonderCam` vision module. Switch the function to color recognition. Create a variable named **"angle"** and set it to 90°. This puts the robotic hand in its initial state.

<img src="../_static/media/chapter_6/section_13/image3.png" class="common_img" />

(2) In the `forever` loop, update and obtain the recognition results. If `color ID1` is recognized, assign the X-axis value of the recognized color's center point to the variable `X-coordinate`.

<img src="../_static/media/chapter_6/section_13/image4.png" class="common_img" />

:::{Note}
In the color recognition, if a color is recognized, the recognized color area will be displayed on the screen of the vision module. It is framed out by a rectangle. In the above image, X-coordinate of `color ID:1` represents the X-axis coordinate value of the rectangular frame's center point.
:::

(3) Based on the obtained X-axis coordinate value, set a range of 150 to 170. If the value of `X-coordinate` exceeds this range, which is greater than 170 or less than 150, the pan-tilt servo will be controlled to rotate. This enables the color tracking. The calculation method for adjusting the angle is:

If the X-axis coordinate value is less than 150, take the value of `150 - X-coordinate`, reduce it by 0.06 times, and round it to add it to the `angle` variable. When servo 6 is greater than 90°, the robotic hand rotates to the left.

Similarly, if the X-axis coordinate value is greater than 170, take the value of "X-coordinate - 170", reduce it by 0.06 times, and round it to add it to the `Angle` variable.

<img src="../_static/media/chapter_6/section_13/image5.png" class="common_img" />

:::{Note}
*   As the screen width of the vision module is 320 pixels, the X-axis coordinate value of the screen's center point is 160. Control `servo 6` to adjust left or right based on the difference between the X-axis coordinate value of the color's center point and that of the screen's center point. This keeps the color area in the center of the screen.

*   Set the range of the screen's center point to 150 to 170, allowing a deviation of 10 pixels to the left or right of the center point. Only when the difference between the X-axis coordinate value of the color area's center point and that of the screen's center point exceeds this deviation, the `servo 6` can be controlled to rotate. This helps to prevent frequent adjustments of `servo 6`.
:::

(4) Check whether the calculated `Angle` variable exceeds the actual range of the servo (0,180). If it exceeds the range, set the `angle` variable to the maximum or minimum value accordingly. Next, set `servo 6` to rotate to the position of the `angle` variable.
